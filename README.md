# A rust programming tutorial
---
<p>This is a rust programming tutorial made as a learning project,
with heavy inspiration taken from Akuli's [python tutorial](https://github.com/Akuli/python-tutorial). 
Throughout the tutorial, I'm going to compare some features of rust to their equivalents in python,
though rust is a very different language compared to python, and they're generally used for vastly
different things. The reason I'm using python as a comparison point is just that it's the only language
I've done things with currently (as of march 2025). A much better comparison point to rust would be
the C language, but since I obviously have no experience with it, it wouldn't be beneficial to use it 
for comparisons for the sake of my own learning about rust. <p>

<p> Like in Akuli's python tutorial, I'm going to try to use code examples to explain things with as little
plain text as possible, except for at the start to introduce some things. But unlike in that tutorial, I'm going to assume you already know some basic
programming concepts, and you also have a basic idea of what programming is and what it is like to do.
If you don't know what programming is yet, or you don't know about things like loops, functions,
and conditional statements like if and else, then you probably shouldn't be venturing into rust yet,
and you should instead begin with a language like python or javascript (plus html and css with it),
that are a lot more beginner friendly. You should look those languages up, and if python seems like
a fit for you, then I recommend reading through the aforementioned python tutorial. 
There are new concepts in rust for literally everybody if they haven't used rust before, like the concept of "ownership and borrowing"
, which will surely be interesting to explore, and there will be a lot for me to learn while making this project and
also for you to learn while reading this tutorial, hopefully. <p>
