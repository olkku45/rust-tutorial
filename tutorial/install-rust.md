# Install Rust

<p> Installing and launching Rust is a bit different compared to any other programming language, and languages tend to be unique in this aspect,
so let's get into it.<p>

## Installing Rust

### Windows

1. Go to https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install 
2. Click on the 64-bit installer if you're on a modern 64-bit machine, or the 32-bit installer if you're on an older 32-bit machine. 
3. Click on the setup that has downloaded.
4. It will take you to a command prompt, and just follow the on screen instructions, you can pretty much just select default on all.
5. Rust is now hopefully installed on your machine.

### Linux and MacOS

1. Either go to https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install or follow along from here.
2. Open up your terminal and copy and paste the following command into it: ```curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions.
4. Rust is now hopefully installed on your machine.
